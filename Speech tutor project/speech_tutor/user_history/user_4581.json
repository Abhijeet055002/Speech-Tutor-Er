      "grammar_feedback": " Corrected Sentence:\nQuantum entanglement can impact the efficiency of a large-scale, distributed quantum computing network.\n\nExplanation:\nThe student's sentence lacked the auxiliary verb \"can\" which is necessary to express ability or possibility in the present. The phrase \"the quantum entanglement impact\" was rephrased as \"quantum entanglement can impact\" for clarity and grammatical correctness. Additionally, the phrase \"large-scale distributed quantum computing network\" was left unchanged but it should be noted that the use of the hyphen after \"large-scale\" is optional in this context.",
      "pronunciation_feedback": "1. Unclear pronunciation can be caused by various factors such as poor diction, lack of enunciation, rapid speech, or accent differences. In this case, the words flagged seem to have been pronounced with a reduced clarity due to either one or more of these factors.\n\n- Word: \"The\" \u2014 Tip: Practice articulating each syllable clearly and separately to ensure that 'th' is distinctly heard and not merged with other sounds.\n- Word: \"quantum\" \u2014 Tip: Break down the word into smaller parts like 'quant' + 'um' and practice pronouncing them individually before combining them.\n- Word: \"entanglement\" \u2014 Tip: Practice articulating each syllable clearly, focusing on the vowel sounds to ensure clarity.\n- Word: \"impact\" \u2014 Tip: Make sure the stress is placed correctly, emphasizing the second syllable (on the 'p').\n- Word: \"large\" \u2014 Tip: Be mindful of not slurring the 'r' sound and enunciating each syllable clearly.\n- Word: \"-scale\" \u2014 Tip: Practice pronouncing this prefix slowly and deliberately, emphasizing the 's' sound.\n\n2. General Tip 1: Speak more slowly and articulate each word carefully to improve clarity.\n3. General Tip 2: Practice with recordings or speech recognition tools to get immediate feedback on your pronunciation and make adjustments accordingly.",
      "comparison_feedback": "1. Comparison:\nThe user's answer briefly touches upon the impact of quantum entanglement on large-scale distributed quantum computing, but it lacks detail and a clear structure. The ideal answer, on the other hand, provides a more comprehensive exploration of the topic by addressing the unique properties of quantum entanglement, discussing their implications in large-scale networks, and offering a well-reasoned argument about potential efficiency improvements or challenges.\n\n2. Suggestions to improve:\n   - To make the answer more relevant and detailed, consider expanding on the characteristics of quantum entanglement (such as non-locality and superposition) and their practical implications in large-scale distributed quantum computing networks. Provide examples or specific aspects like communication speed, resource allocation, and fault tolerance where applicable.\n   - To improve structure and fluency, consider organizing your answer in a logical sequence, with an introduction, body, and conclusion. Use transitions between sections to make the flow of ideas smooth and easy to follow for the reader. Additionally, ensure that your grammar and vocabulary are accurate and appropriate for academic or professional discourse.",
