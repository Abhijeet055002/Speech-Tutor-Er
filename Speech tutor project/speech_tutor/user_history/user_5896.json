      "grammar_feedback": " Corrected Sentence:\n\"I would like to know what you are thinking or asking.\"\n\nExplanation:\nWhen a person asks a question, it's important that the answer provides clear information. In this case, since no specific question was asked, a general response is necessary. The corrected sentence asks for the other person to share what they are thinking or asking. This is grammatically correct because it uses the first-person pronoun \"I\" (which refers to the speaker) and the second-person pronoun \"you\" (which refers to the listener). Additionally, it uses the present tense verb \"am\" for the subject \"I\" and the infinitive form \"to be\" followed by a gerund \"thinking\" for the predicate of the question. The phrase \"or asking\" is added as an alternative in case the other person was intending to ask a question but didn't express it clearly.",
      "pronunciation_feedback": "1. Unclear pronunciation can occur due to several factors, including improper articulation, rapid speech, lack of breath control, and accent differences. In this case, the word \"You\" might be unclear because of a quick or muffled delivery.\n\n2. Word: \"You\" \u2014 Tip: Pronounce each syllable clearly and ensure that each vowel sound is heard distinctly. For example, say \"Yoo-ou\" instead of \"Yuh-ou\". Also, practice speaking at a slower pace to improve clarity.\n\n   General Tips:\n\n   1. Practice good breath control by taking deep breaths before starting to speak and pausing after each sentence or phrase. This will help maintain clear pronunciation throughout your speech.\n\n   2. Record yourself speaking and listen back to identify areas where you need improvement. Focus on enunciating each word carefully and clearly, paying attention to the flow and rhythm of your speech. Regular practice will help improve fluency and clarity.",
      "comparison_feedback": "1. Comparison:\nThe user's spoken answer \"You\" does not directly address the question or follow a logical structure. In contrast, an ideal answer would provide relevant information or insights based on the prompt given.\n\n  2. Suggestions to Improve:\n    - To improve relevance and structure, consider providing a complete response that is related to the question asked.\n    - To enhance grammar and vocabulary usage, make sure to use appropriate sentence structures and varied words when responding. Avoid one-word answers whenever possible. For example, \"I am an assistant designed to help you with questions or tasks.\"",
